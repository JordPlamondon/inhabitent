**What I learned:**

I enjoyed the concept of wordpress and how it functions. I learned how to create page templates, use the wordpress dashboard to my advantage, and how to target certain components of the partials without affecting other created pages. I figured out how to get terms, get posts and get template directory intuitively, making my website easier to structure and fetch the data needed with less code. I had issues with MAMP that finally got resolved near the end of the project, making the time I had planned to put into it a little constrained. I will finish the rest of the needed php and styling so that the website is in 100% working order.
