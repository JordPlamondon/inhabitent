# RED Starter

A WordPress starter theme for RED Academy students, forked from Underscores.

## Installation

### 1. Download me (don't clone me!)

Then add me to your `wp-content` directory.

### 2. Rename the `redstarter-master` directory

Make sure that the theme directory name is project appropriate!

### 3. Install the dev dependencies

Next you'll need to run `npm install` **inside your theme directory** next to install the node modules you'll need for Gulp, etc.

### 4. Update the proxy in `gulpfile.js`

Lastly, be sure to update your `gulpfile.js` with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so change `localhost[:port-here]/[your-dir-name-here]` to the appropriate localhost URL).

**What I learned:**

I enjoyed the concept of wordpress and how it functions. I learned how to create page templates, use the wordpress dashboard to my advantage, and how to target certain components of the partials without affecting other created pages. I figured out how to get terms, get posts and get template directory intuitively, making my website easier to structure and fetch the data needed with less code. I had issues with MAMP that finally got resolved near the end of the project, making the time I had planned to put into it a little constrained. I will finish the rest of the needed php and styling so that the website is in 100% working order.
